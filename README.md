My config files that I've been using for years.
I tried to make them portable and machine-independent as much as possible.
The majority of them I wrote in the period of 2018-2021.
So for now this repo will rather serve as archive and probably will never be updated.
With this particular directory structure I used [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) and [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to manage and sync these files locally between the machines.
